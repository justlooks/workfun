安装
wget -q -O - http://www.atomicorp.com/installers/atomic |sh
yum -y install openvas

设置
#openvas-setup
就是以下操作步骤
下载nvt
/usr/sbin/openvas-nvt-sync
下载cert数据
/usr/sbin/openvas-certdata-sync
下载scap数据 (时间比较长)
/usr/sbin/openvas-scapdata-sync
生成客户端证书 （原脚本路径是/usr/sbin/openvas-mkcert-client是错误的)
/usr/bin/openvas-mkcert-client -n -i
启动扫描器
/sbin/service openvas-scanner restart

/usr/sbin/openvasmd --migrate
启动manager (此时无法启动，需要先运行openvasmd --rebuild --progress）
/sbin/service openvas-manager restart
继续无法启动，因为必须用下列命令 (bug http://lists.wald.intevation.org/pipermail/openvas-discuss/2015-November/009044.html)
# openvasmd --listen=0.0.0.0
启动gsad(改写如下项目)
# vi /etc/sysconfig/gsad
GSA_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0
service gsad restart
添加admin账户
# openvasmd  --create-user=admin
# openvasmd  --user=admin --new-password=wqeasd
配置redis,打开如下选项
unixsocket /tmp/redis.sock
unixsocketperm 700

[root@internal_server2 redis]# openvas-check-setup
openvas-check-setup 2.3.0

解决办法
# wget http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:ods/CentOS_CentOS-6/home:ods.repo
# yum install alien

openvas建立任务在1%进度刮起



登录报错
Login failed. Waiting for OMP service to become available.

检查安装
#openvas-check-setup


重启扫描器
/etc/init.d/openvas-scanner restart



# openvas-mkcert-client -n -i

yum downgrade openvas-manager

发现日志报数据库被锁错误

解决方法
fuser /var/lib/openvas/mgr/tasks.db
/var/lib/openvas/mgr/tasks.db:  5466 18524
然后kill 5466 18524 两个进程

openvas-check-setup 脚本运行错误（检查gsad启动两个端口不正常）
